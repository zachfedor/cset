Why do you think it's important that HTML is an open standard controlled by a specification rather than being owned by one person or company?

I am not exactly sure what would change for sure, but what I do know is that there would definitely be limitations somewhere in the private-owned HTML compared to the public HTML. My biggest idea is that you would have to pay a small fee to use HTML, but for all I know that could be true already. So my speculation only really goes as far as limited access to the privately-owned HTML.

Describe the difference between an element and a tag. Use examples.

An element is the content that you see on a website. Whether it is a word, paragragh, link or anything that you see in website, it originally starts out as an element in a tag.
The way you see things inside of the website is because of tags. Tags and their names tell developers what inside the tag, the element, is to the website and what it will do. As an example, the <p> tag, or paragraph tag, is a tag that accepts text to create a paragraph. Whatever is between the start tag and the end tag is then printed out like its a paragraph. 

In the lecture, I used two quotes from Yoda and Noam Chomsky to explain syntax and semantics. Explain these quotes and how they relate to the HTML you write.

The Yoda quote had the semantics of language down, but its syntax was wrong, while Chomsky's quote had the syntax down, but its semantics were all over the place. Semantics tells us what it means while syntax tells us how it is structured. HTML follows the same structure because of how errors show themselves. You could have the HTML syntax down pat when you write code, but not everyone could read it and be able to read it like you do, which is a failure of semantics. Or you could have very readable code, but no-one knows how you got there, which is bad syntax. The HTML that we write will have to have a balance of syntax and semantics, written by the rules that we have set up, while also being readable
for everyone reading it.
