In your opinion, what is the most important thing you learned this week? Why?

I think the most important thing I learned this week is, console.log(), because this will show me how or why a specific line of code works. If I'm learning something new I can't always understand how something works if I'm reading itI think  but it helps me to learn better if its shown to me. I'm a visual and hands on learner.

Describe the general idea of high and low level programming languages using the concept of abstraction.

A high level programming language wil use human-like language, for example, english text. High level languages are easier for humans to understand but harder for computers because the language doesn't recemble the computer's own architectual language or commands. Low level languages will recemble the computer's architectual commands or functions. They can run without being converted to machine code, which means that the computer can easily understand the language. 

JavaScript was designed to be flexible with values and types, often jumping back and forth between them. Compare some pros and cons of this decision. How might it help you? How might it get in the way?

I think that the automatic conversion will help me a lot because I'm new to coding and I can see myself making a lot of accidental mistakes. Although, I can imagine that JavaScript will use that even when it isn't needed, which will get in the way sometimes. I think booleans will help me because they're true or false statements. The three different types of quotes for strings might make things confusing for some people because the backtick looks similar to the apostrophe. The console.log() is very useful, it helps to show you waht happens and prints out the result.
